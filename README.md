# Geotechnical-Desktop-Data
A collection of places to find data for geotechnical desktop studies. It currenly has an Australian focus, but am happy to add other areas.

Pull requests welcome.

## Geoscience/Mining data
### South Australia
* [South Australian Geomaps](http://www.minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/online_tools/free_data_delivery_and_publication_downloads/digital_maps_and_data) - maps and geology data from South Australia
* [Geoscientific Data](http://www.minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/geoscience/geoscientific_data) - includes geophysics, maps, earthquakes and remote sensing data
* [SARIG](https://map.sarig.sa.gov.au/) - South Australian Resources Information Gateway. Contains all sorts of geology/geophysics data

### New South Wales
* [Geoscience NSW](http://www.resourcesandenergy.nsw.gov.au/miners-and-explorers/geoscience-information) - a list of the various services available to miners/fossickers in NSW. Includes maps, reports, drill cores, etc. Services include DIGS, MinView, GADDS and more
* [AUSGIN](http://www.geoscience.gov.au/) - the Australian Geoscience information network. Geophysics, geology, boreholes etc
* [Burea of Meterology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/) - climate data from BOM

### Western Australia
* [DMIRS Data and Software Centre](https://dasc.dmp.wa.gov.au/dasc/) - ets you download state-wide spatial datasets, geology series map data, resources

### Other Parts of the world
* [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) - simply awesome
* [NASA Data](https://data.nasa.gov/) - there's too much here to unpack easily
* [LandSat data](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/where-to-get-data/) - remote sensing data
* [ESA remote sensing data](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/data-access) - there's alot here as well, but it does include SAR data for interferometry
* [NOAA data](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset) - there's an endless suppy here.

### Not quite geotechnical 
* [Other data from departments all over Australia](http://data.gov.au/dataset) - lots of administrative stuff
